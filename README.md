## Simplify Author List Generation in LaTeX

Wrote a paper with 22 authors with many different affiliations, unfortunatelty different publishers have different unique ways they would like authors to be formatted. This can be a huge headache to deal with when changing format to a different publisher.

This Jupyter notebook provides some functions to abstract away these differences and allow you to create your author list only once.

Methods provided work for Elsevier journals and Nature Journals, pull requests adding formats for other journals are appreciated
